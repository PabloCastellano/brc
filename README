brc
===

Broadcaster component. Allows you to connect to Bitcoin nodes and
broadcast a transaction to them with feedback over ZMQ sockets.

Push transaction with REQ socket to port 9109.
Socket will respond back with either 1 (true) or 0 (fail).
Failure only happens because it couldn't deserialize the transaction data
before broadcasting.

Port 9110 will reply back with a message that has 3 frames:

  [ tx_hash:32 ]
  [ success:8  ] (little-endian, number of successes)
  [ failure:8  ] (little-endian, number of failures)

The success and failures simply indicate whether the transaction got
delivered or not. It does not say anything about the validity of that
transaction.

If the transaction cannot be deserialized the daemon outputs "Bad stream"
but does nothing further.

Port 9112 will reply back with...


You can change the ports in define.hpp

  $ ./brc -h
  INFO: Usage: brc [ZMQ_TRANSPORT] [CLIENT_CERTS_DIR]
  INFO: Example: brc tcp://*:8989
  INFO: An empty CLIENT_CERTS_DIR will accept all certificates.
  INFO: See ZMQ manual for more info.

Simple invocation:

  $ ./brc

For testing see the test/ subdirectory.

  $ cd test/
  $ python listen.py &
  $ python poke.py
  $ python connections.py

And watch the output of the brc terminal.
